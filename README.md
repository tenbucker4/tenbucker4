- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @tenbucker4
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m an analytical chemist by education, but I'm determined to teach myself programming and eventually become a software developer!
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning some basics (HTML, CSS, Javascript), but I'm eager to dive further into programming languages and get started working on some really cool projects.
